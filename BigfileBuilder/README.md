# Bigfile

## Data

The Bigfile data file is simply storing all files right after one another.
Using file alignment specified in the IBigfileConfig, files are aligned in the Bigfile data file.
Each file written to the Bigfile will remember the position and size in the Bigfile data file which are used to build the TOC.

## TOC

The TOC file can contain multiple TOC-Sections.

The main TOC layout:
  - Int32: Number of Entries (Total)
  - Int32: Number of Sections
  - Array {Int32:toc count, Int32:toc offset, Int64:data offset}

## TOC Section

A TOC Section layout:
  - Array {Int32: file offset, Int32: file size}
    - Offset can be an offset to a FileId[], depends on bit 31 in FileSize
  - Array {Int32: length, FileId[]: array}

## Bigfile Filenames and Hashes

These are now following the same layout as mentioned above containing multiple sections.

## Bigfile Organization

So during development we will have multiple loose Big files and only for a final release we will merge them into one Bigfile.
Every Bigfile has an associated `index`, and each FileId that is written in the game data is composed of a Bigfile `index` 
and a BigfileFile `index`.

There is one Bigfile per DataUnit.

Note: At this moment we do not care about de-duplication, we could add it later.
